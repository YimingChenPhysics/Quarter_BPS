# Quarter_BPS
Numerical results for the one loop anomalous dimensions and projected operators in the quarter BPS sector of SU(4) \mathcal{N}=4 SYM. See companion paper "BPS chaos" arXiv:2407.19387 by Yiming Chen, Henry Lin and Stephen Shenker for more details of the setup.

Files can be imported into Mathematica. In each sector, deltaE.wdx includes the anomalous dimensions, while Osimp.mx gives the the projected operator in the eigenbasis that is ordered by the anomalous dimensions from greater to smaller (same as deltaE.wdx). Note that the basis are not normalized so the matrix is not Hermitian.
